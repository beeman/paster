# Paster

Paster is an small application that lets you collect snippets of text so that you can easily copy them to the clipboard, and paste them later.

It is created for people who have to answer the same questions by email, multiple times a day. They enter the answer in the tool one time and then just copy it when needed. :)

Paster is written in Java and uses a SQLite database. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux.
